- ` 3 Learning and teaching functionality - Creating a new class`:
All registered users have the permission to create normal class, the only requirement is the conclusion of licenced classes before posting new contents (the manner to conclude will be commented below, on section 3.a). For instance, always that a new language is added to the application, it will be added with five modules (which is based on Common European Framework of Reference for Languages – CEFR). So, after concluding A1 module a user can post a A1 class and access A2 module.

- ` 3.a Learning and teaching functionality - Accessing a class `:
The languages are sorted on the languages menu. After choosing which idiom to study, a user is redirected to idiom page, which is separated in three sections: Class, Forum and Dictionary. The first view is the classes. This view displays the normal classes and the licenced modules. The user can enter to a licenced class through the modules. To conclude a class, the user can watch the class vídeo and, after it, do the activite linked to the class. The way to finish a class is to have 70% or more of the questions marked as correct.
